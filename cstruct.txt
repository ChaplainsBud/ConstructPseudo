2 Tests 

1. Process Customer Record

input: name and cost 
selection: control flow according to tax code

sequence: receive arguments
selection: apply operations based on code number
repetition

Read customer's name
Read purchase amount
Apply Tax Code:

if tax code is equal to zero,
 subtract price from (price multiply by 0) and (price modulus by 0)

if else tax code is equual to 1, then state sales tax only, 
  subtract price from (multiply by .03) and (price modulus by .03)

if else federal and state sales tax is equal to 2,
  subtract price from (multiply by .05) and (price modulus by .05)

else special stales tax, 
  subtract price from (multiply by .07) and (price modulus by .07)
 
Put the total amount due and sales tax into variables
Create an object, log out or return keys and values:
customer's name, purchase amount, sales tax, and total amount due

i.TestA: Fred, $10

return: 

name: Fred
price: $10
code: 0
deduction:0
price: $10

ii. TestB: Vlad, $20

name: Vlad
price: $20
code: 1
deduction: 0.60
price: $19.40


2. Calculate Employee's Pay

sequence: receive arguments
selection: apply operations based on code number
repetition

i. Declare function with parameters for employee's number, pay rate, and number of hours 
worked
ii. Look up pay rate and hours by employee's number.
iii. Multiply pay rate by number of hours.
iv. 
v.  if number of hours exceeds 60, return invalid hours;
    if pay rate exceeds $25.00, return invalid pay rate;
    if number of hours exceeds 60 and pay rate exceeds $25.00, return invalid hours and pay rate.

computer employee's weekly pay

vi.
if valid, print
if invalid, do not print 

---- Comments:
max hours == 60 
max hourly rate == $25.00

Log out or return: hours worked times pay rate; if more than 35 hours are worked,
payment for overtime hours worked is time-and-a-half
